# Variants Assessment

## Assessment Notes

### Variant E Implementation Decision
**Task**: "Add a key benefit bullets section underneath the headline"

**Decision**: Added benefits section underneath the headline within the hero section itself.

**Reasoning**: The task didn't specify whether "underneath the headline" meant:
- Within the hero section (below headline, above CTA)
- Below the entire hero section

I chose the more conservative interpretation to avoid assumptions.

### Technical Issues Encountered

#### Chrome Extension Version Warning
```
Chrome extension out of date. Installed v1.2.15, required v1.2.16.
```
This warning appeared consistently during testing.

#### Rendering Differences
The target page (https://learn.memoryair.com/salespage/) renders differently when accessed:
- **Direct browser visit**: Standard rendering
- **Through extension**: Modified rendering

This discrepancy may affect variant testing accuracy.
